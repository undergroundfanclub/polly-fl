# holly-home
way to clone my setup to different machines

welcome to my home.
this script is meant to be installed on vanilla debian.
you shouldn't need any repos besides buster main.
all the packages are free.

while this setup probably wont be the favorite among some, im mainly using this for myself.
so feel free to use it, but at this point i dont see a point in trying to adjust it for others.
i hope you understand.

# how to install
install a debian buster
then simply 
```
git clone https://github.com/undergroundfanclub/holly-home.git
cd holly-home
chmod +x
./install.sh
```
