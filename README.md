# pollybug-deploy (0.1.5)
way to clone my setup to different machines

welcome to my free debian flavor.
this script is meant to be installed on vanilla debian (main).
you can install from just tty1, the script should take care xorg, xinit, and setting up directories.
you shouldn't need any repos besides buster main.
all the packages are free.

while this setup probably wont be the favorite among some, im mainly using this for myself.
so feel free to use it, but at this point i dont see a point in trying to adjust it for others.
i hope you understand.

# prerequisites
all you need is to have sudo setup for you user, and git to clone the repo

# how to install
```
git clone https://github.com/undergroundfanclub/polly-fl.git
cd polly-fl
./install.sh
```
this is reccomended to be installed on the netinstall iso: with no packages selected during "package-selection"
